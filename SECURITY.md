# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows a rolling release model, meaning there are no distinct release versions.
We only address security issues affecting the latest git commit of the [main branch](https://github.com/Zaczero/openstreetmap-ng/tree/main).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take a security-first approach to development.
If you suspect you've found a security issue in our project, we urge you to report it to us promptly, regardless of the perceived severity.
Your report helps us protect our users and the integrity of our codebase.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're unsure whether an issue has security implications, it's safest to assume it has and report it.

To report a vulnerability, you can either use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting feature or contact the maintainers directly.
